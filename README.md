# IM101 (Pastry E-Commerce)

This system only dedicates to me cheers to my stupid groupmates :thread:

## Softwares I used during development

1. XAMPP / PHP
2. SQL / phpmyadmin
3. ChatGPT 
4. Excalidraw + DrawIO (Database Design)
5. Git (only me)

## Requirements to run

1. Just import my sql file which can be found thru this directory `models/im101-pastry.sql`
2. Make sure that your database name should be this `im101-pastry` and nothing else.
3. Shut the fuck up just google it to find more solution.

## Realtime Status

This system only relies to Academic Activities therefore this kind is written by PHP form so for latest status I decided to rewrite this kind written in Ruby on Rails.

Please refer <a href="https://gitlab.com/kenbusano/treiven">here</a> for latest kind.
